Definition:
    Merge Sort is a highly efficient, stable, and comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides an array into smaller, more manageable pieces, sorts them, and then merges them back together.

Advantages:
    -Efficiency: Highly efficient for large datasets.
    -Stability: Maintains the relative order of equal elements.
    -Parallelizable: Can be implemented efficiently in parallel processing.

Disadvantages:
    -Space Complexity: Requires additional memory space proportional to the size of the original array.

Real-Life Applicable Examples:
    -External Hard Drives: Useful for sorting and organizing large files.
    -Database Sorting: Applied in sorting large datasets in databases.

Time and Space Complexity:
    -Time Complexity:
        Best Case: O(n log n)
        Average Case: O(n log n)
        Worst Case: O(n log n)
    -Space Complexity:
        O(n) for additional memory during merging.
