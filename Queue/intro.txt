Definition:
    A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In, First-Out (FIFO) principle. The element that enters first is the first to be removed.

Advantages:
    -Efficient for process management in operating systems.
    -Fundamental in breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms.

Disadvantages:
    -Not suitable for tasks that require random access to elements.

Applications:
    -Operating Systems: Manages processes in a first-come, first-served manner.
    -Print Queue: Organizes print jobs in submission order.

Implementation Examples:
    -BFS Algorithms: Used for efficient tree or graph traversal.
    -Scheduling Algorithms: Determines the next task or process to execute.
