Definition:
    Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm that divides the input array into two parts: the sorted part and the unsorted part. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest) element       from the unsorted part and swaps it with the first element of the unsorted part.

Advantages:
    -Simplicity: Easy to understand and implement.
    -In-Place Sorting: Requires very little additional memory space.

Disadvantages:
    -Inefficiency: Inefficient for large datasets, as it has a time complexity of O(n^2).
    -Lack of Adaptivity: Doesn't adapt to the data, performs the same steps regardless of the input.

Applications:
    -Small Datasets: Can be suitable for sorting very small datasets where simplicity is more important than efficiency.
    -Teaching Tool: Frequently used in educational contexts to teach basic sorting concepts.

Real-Life Applicable Examples:
    -Education: Used as a pedagogical tool to introduce sorting algorithms due to its simplicity.
    -Simple Scenarios: Applicable in situations where efficiency is less critical compared to simplicity.

Time Complexity:
        Best Case: O(n^2)
        Average Case: O(n^2)
        Worst Case: O(n^2)
