    Definition:
        Quick Sort is a highly efficient, comparison-based sorting algorithm known for its speed and effectiveness on a wide range of datasets.

    Advantages:
        -Efficiency: One of the fastest sorting algorithms, especially for large datasets.
        -In-Place Sorting: Requires very little additional memory space.
        -Good Average Case: Works well on average with O(n log n) time complexity.

    Disadvantages:
        -Worst-Case Performance: Can have poor performance on already sorted or nearly sorted arrays.

    Applications:
        -General Sorting: Widely used for sorting large datasets in various applications.
        -Sorting Libraries: Forms the basis of many standard library sorting functions.

    Real-Life Applicable Examples:
        -Libraries and Databases: Utilized for sorting and organizing large collections of data.
        -File Systems: Applied in file systems to maintain order of files and directories.

    Time and Space Complexity:
        -Time Complexity:
            Best Case: O(n log n)
            Average Case: O(n log n)
            Worst Case: O(n^2) (rare, but possible)
        -Space Complexity: O(log n)
